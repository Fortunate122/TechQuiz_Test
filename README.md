# Tech Quiz

## Description
Tech Quiz is a full-stack quiz application built using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and Vite. The application delivers randomized true/false style technical questions and tracks the user's score. Users can restart the quiz at any time. It is fully tested with Cypress for both component and end-to-end scenarios.

## Motivation
My goal was to build a dynamic and interactive quiz experience that loads randomized questions from an API, tracks user progress and score, and demonstrates a clean frontend/backend separation. I also wanted to practice modern React and full E2E testing using Cypress.

## Usage
The user starts the quiz by clicking a button, answers 10 true/false questions, and is shown their final score. The frontend uses React with Bootstrap for styling, while the backend serves question data via a RESTful API.

## License
This project is licensed under the None license.

## Learning
I strengthened my skills in full-stack development with modern tooling. I implemented API mocking in Cypress, ensured React components updated state correctly, and practiced type safety across server-client boundaries.

## Standout
What makes my project stand out is the following:
- Backend API using Express serves dynamic questions
- Frontend quiz experience built with React + Vite
- Full test coverage with Cypress (unit, component, and E2E)
- Mocking and intercepting API data during tests
- No third-party quiz APIs used â€” fully self-hosted
